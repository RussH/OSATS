----------

* New pipeline status "Candidate declined", still has to be added to the pipeline graph

* Made database charset configurable via dbconfig.php

* New option EMAIL_CHARSET in config.php

* New option EMAIL_SEND_HTML in config.php

* New option EMAIL_WITH_SIGNATURE in config.php

* lib/Mailer.php: send no signature by default

* Made e-mail subject configurable for candidate notification e-mails

* Added new placeholder %SALUTATION% for e-mail templates. The salutation is chosen according
  to the candidate's gender ("Dear Mrs." or "Dear Mr.", or the i18n'd string respectively).

* Added new placeholder %CANDLASTNAME" for e-mail templates.

* Allow extra fields as placeholders in e-mail templates

* Allow individual e-mail templates for status change notifications sent to candidates:
  If there exists a template tagged EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STATUSCHANGE_[status_id] in the 
  'email_template' table, it will be used. Otherwise, the default EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STATUSCHANGE
  template will be used.
  NOTE: This change required a tweak to the e-mail generation mechanism. Now, on every change
  of the status dropdown control, the respective template is loaded via an AJAX request.
  This may make the UI feel slow on remote internet connections, calling for a "spinner"
  visual feedback yet to be implemented.

* Open attachments in a _blank window

* Added a google maps link to the candidate addres view

* In modules/candidates/Edit.tpl and .../Add.tpl, added a conditional in order to display 
  address, zip and city in the correct order when I18N_DEFAULT is set to 'de_DE'

* Added several translations

* Some minor bugfixes
